# 2048 Solver

This project is intended to "solve" the popular [2048 tile-merging game](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048).
See the [roadmap](/roadmap.md) for details on the project.

Although most of the ideas I'll use are taken directly from others' projects, I want to try writing most of the source code myself.
There are some implementation ideas that I'm taking as well (such as the bitwise board transposition [code](https://github.com/nneonneo/2048-ai/blob/master/2048.cpp#L38-L48)), but most of the code should be my own.

This project is currently under development.
