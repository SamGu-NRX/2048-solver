# Logs Directory

This directory is used for storing game records and benchmark logs during development and testing.

Log files are typically large and contain encoded game sequences. They are excluded from version control to keep the repository size manageable.

To generate logs, run the benchmark or testing scripts with appropriate output redirection.
